        <h2>Myths vs Facts</h2>
        <p>Menstruation is natural, not impure. Avoiding normal activities during periods is a myth.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
  <h2>Do's:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong></strong> <h4>1. Stay Hydrated</h4>
Staying hydrated is crucial during your period to prevent cramping and bloating. Aim for 8-10 glasses of water a day. Herbal teas, especially those with chamomile or ginger, can also help relieve cramps and replenish fluids.

<li><strong></strong> <h4>2. Use a Heating Pad</h4>
A heating pad can work wonders in relaxing your muscles and relieving cramps. Place it on your lower abdomen or back for quick relief. A warm bath can also help you feel better and soothe any discomfort.

<li><strong></strong> <h4>3. Do Light Exercise</h4>
While intense workouts might not be ideal, light exercises like walking, yoga, or swimming can boost your mood and ease discomfort. Gentle movement helps release endorphins, which can alleviate pain and improve your overall sense of well-being.

<li><strong></strong> <h4>4. Pamper Yourself</h4>
There's no better time for some self-care. Relax and pamper yourself by reading a book, journaling, or indulging in a long bath. Watching movies, cooking comfort food, and spending time with loved ones can also help you feel more at ease during your period..</li>

  <h2> Don'ts:</h2>
  <ul>
   
       <li><strong></strong> <h4>1. Heavy Lifting and Intense Exercise</h4>
Avoid strenuous exercise and heavy lifting during your period. Your body is already under stress, so take it easy. Focus on light activities that make you feel good without overexerting yourself.
<li><strong></strong> <h4>2. Caffeine and Alcohol</h4>
Limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol during your period. These can worsen cramps, bloating, and mood swings. Instead, opt for herbal teas, lemon water, or decaffeinated coffee to stay hydrated and balanced.
<li><strong></strong> <h4>3. Salty and Sugary Foods</h4>
Though it’s tempting to reach for chips, pretzels, or chocolate, these salty and sugary foods can make you feel more bloated and irritable. Choose fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to keep your energy levels steady and your mood balanced.
<li><strong></strong> <h4>4. Being Inactive</h4>
While you should avoid intense workouts, don't fall into the trap of being inactive. Light movement like walking, yoga, or stretching can help ease cramps and boost your mood by releasing endorphins.
<li><strong></strong> <h4>5. Tight Clothing</h4>
Wearing loose, comfortable clothing during your period can help reduce discomfort from cramps and bloating. Opt for flowy dresses, soft pants, and loosely fitted tops to let your belly breathe.
