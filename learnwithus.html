    <li><strong></strong> <h4>1.First Period</h4>
It is very important for a growing young adolescent girl to be aware of the changes that will come during puberty. This is because your body will start to grow and change in new ways, and it can be confusing if you don't know what to expect. Knowing about the changes that will happen can help you feel more prepared and less anxious. It's also important to remember that everyone goes through puberty, and it's a normal part of growing up. By being aware of these changes, you can take care of your body and feel confident and comfortable as you transition into adulthood.

<li><strong></strong> <h4>2.How can I talk to my friends about my period?</h4>
Choose a comfortable and private setting: Find a quiet and comfortable place where you can have an open conversation without distractions or interruptions.
Be honest and straightforward: Let your friends know that you want to talk to them about your period and how it affects you. Be clear and honest about your experiences and feelings.
Use humor if it helps: Talking about periods can be awkward, but using humor can help lighten the mood and make the conversation more comfortable.
Listen to their experiences: Your friends may have their own experiences with periods, so be open to listening to their stories and offering support.
Share helpful resources: Share resources such as articles or apps that help with tracking periods and managing menstrual symptoms.
Normalize the conversation: By talking openly and honestly about your period with your friends, you can help to normalize the conversation around menstruation and reduce stigma.


<li><strong></strong> <h4>3. How can I advocate for menstrual equity and education in my community?</h4>
Start a conversation: Talk to your friends, family, and community members about menstrual equity and education. Share your own experiences and encourage others to share theirs. Use social media platforms to raise awareness and start a dialogue.
Advocate for policy change: Contact your local government officials and advocate for policies that support menstrual equity and education. This can include legislation to provide free menstrual products in schools and public restrooms, as well as policies to ensure that menstrual education is included in school curriculums.
Donate menstrual products: Donate menstrual products to local organizations that support people in need, such as homeless shelters, food banks, and women's health clinics.
Volunteer your time: Volunteer with organizations that work to promote menstrual equity and education. You can help with events, distribute menstrual products, and participate in advocacy campaigns.
<li><strong></strong> <h4>4. What happens during the menstrual phase?</h4>
    During the menstrual phase, the lining of the uterus is shed through the vagina as menstrual blood. This phase typically lasts for 3-7 days, although it can vary from person to person. Menstrual blood is made up of blood and other materials, such as tissue from the lining of the uterus. The amount of blood can also vary, but it is usually around 30-40 milliliters (about two tablespoons) over the course of the entire period.
